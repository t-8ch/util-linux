== NAME

enosys - utility make syscalls fail with ENOSYS

== SYNOPSIS

*enosys* [*--syscall*|*-s* _syscall_] command

== DESCRIPTION

*enosys* is a simple command to execute a child process for which certain
syscalls fail with errno ENOSYS.

It can be used to test the behavior of applications in the face of missing
syscalls as would happen when running on old kernels.

Syscall to block with *ENOSYS*. Can be specified multiple times.
An alternative error number or name can be specified with a colon.

*-i*, *--ioctl*::
Ioctl to block with *ENOTTY*. Can be specified multiple times.
An alternative error number or name can be specified with a colon.

*-l*, *--list*::
List syscalls known to *enosys*.

*-m*, *--list-ioctl*::
List ioctls known to *enosys*.
